/**
 `MVVM` `(Model-View-ViewModel)` is a software design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected parts: the `Model`,
 `View`, and `ViewModel`.
 This separation helps organize code, making it more maintainable, testable, and reusable.
 The `ViewModel` acts as an intermediary between the `View` and `Model`, handling presentation logic and data binding.

/**
 `Components Overview and their roles
 - `View (Controller - UIKit):` It only performs things related to UI ‚Äî Show/get information. Part of the view layer
 - `View Model`: It receives information from VC, handles all this information, and sends it back to VC.
 - `Model: `This is only your model, nothing much here. It‚Äôs the same model as in MVC. It is used by VM and updates whenever VM sends new updates
 */

// MARK: - Model
/**
 üß© `Model`
 The Model represents the application's data and business logic. It encapsulates the core functionalities and rules, independent of the user interface.
 This separation ensures that the business logic remains unaffected by changes in the UI.

 üîÑ `ViewModel`
 The ViewModel acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It retrieves data from the Model, processes it if necessary, and exposes it in a form suitable for the View.
 Additionally, it handles user interactions passed from the View, updating the Model accordingly.
 This component facilitates two-way data binding, ensuring synchronization between the UI and the underlying data.

 The View is the user interface of the application. It displays data provided by the ViewModel and captures user interactions, such as clicks or text input.
